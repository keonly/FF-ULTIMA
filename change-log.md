> This is [userChrome Companion](https://github.com/soulhotel/userChrome-Companion). *Instead of* relying on the **about:config** page and **user.js**, I see a future where FF Ultima works alongside userChrome Companion. Maybe you see that future as well. Depending on the development of `UCC` and how **easier** it is for both you and me, it can become a possibility. Definitely want opinions on this.

## üíù Support:

> This `Support` section will dissappear after this release

So, 1 year ago, I rejected the idea of [Donations](#136). But now I'm at a point where I realize - Income plays a huge part in, the time you have *for the things you love*.

I've gained a lot while maintaining Ultima, like knowledge and an avenue for creativity as a hobby. But I'm losing a lot too. I'm losing time to maintain it. I'm losing the time I could use towards getting started on other projects (Shout out to [userChrome Companion](https://github.com/soulhotel/userChrome-Companion)). I'm losing income in the real world & pretty sure we are all losing income in these current 2025 times.. For anyone that would like to further support the development of FF Ultima or support my efforts in creating/maintaining.. And <ins>ONLY</ins> if you are able to.. You can now:
